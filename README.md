# Storage Gateway

A configurable Cloud Storage Gateway that can also forward requests to targeted servers.

Mostly while handling Base64 photos or binaries, we can upload the same directly to the cloud media servers, this project takes care of the interim parameters, converts the base64 data into binary files, stores them with cloud provider, returns the URI or forwards the URI to respective forward servers.
